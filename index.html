	<h1>This is <span class="ital">still</span> a motherfucking website.</h1><br/>
	<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's</p><br/>
	<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2><br/>
	<h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4><br/>
	<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com"> grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <span class="ital">still</span> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
	<ul>
		<li>Shit's <span class="ital">still</span> lightweight and loads fast</li>
		<li><span class="ital">Still</span> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
		<li><span class="ital">Still</span> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
		<li>The motherfucker's <span class="ital">still</span> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
		<li>Shit's <span class="ital">still</span> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3><br/>
	<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p><br/>
	<h2>Let it breathe</h2><br/>
	<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum<span class="comic"> line-height: 1.4 </span>for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p><br/>
	<p>If your text hits the side of browser, fucke off forever. You ever see a book like that?</p>
	<p>Yes? What a shitty book.</p><br/>
	<h2>A little less contrast</h2><br/>
	<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p><br/>
	<h2>Size Matters</h2><br/>
	<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p><br/>
	<h2>Line-width,motherfucker</h2><br/>
	<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p><br/>
	<h4>Yes,this is <span class="ital">also</span> fucking satire,you fuck</h4><br/>
	<p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p><br/>
